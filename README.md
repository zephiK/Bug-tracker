How to report an issue?
-----------------------

First and foremost, read the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwBCTR_Kz1cLbdUr3myp05PVfxK_f31Oty5K2PieFng/edit?usp=sharing) before you post anything. 
If the FAQ didn't help, check the tracker if your issue has been reported already. DO NOT create a duplicate report.

Now, make sure you copy this template on to the issue description before you type it out. Makes things easier for you and us.
```
Do you use Xposed framework? If yes, do not even bother reporting.
Uninstall Xposed(&reboot), check if the bug you're trying to report still
exists and then proceed. Otherwise,your report will be declared invalid.

Your device:

Which ROM version are you using? (provide download link)

What kernel are you using - included in the ROM or from another source?
(provide xda/download link)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.
2.
3.

What is the expected result? What do you see instead?

Is the result seen after a clean flash too?

Attach a logcat and/or a last_kmsg . Without this,the issue is impossible
to fix.
